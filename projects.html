            <div class="textentry">Developed an anomaly detection system that periodically looks at logs to determine if there is any
                unexpected behaviour in the
                incoming HTTP requests and responses.
                The software compares the data at a given time interval to the data of a given time interval 7 days ago,
                14 days ago and 21 days ago, and uses the rolling mean to determine if it is an anomaly.
                A sudden spike in responses that exceeds the upper bound of the rolling mean suggests there is an
                anomaly and reports it via the bot.
                If any unexpected behaviour is found, the bot sends out a message with detailed information regarding
                the detected anomaly.
                <br/>
                The bot was able to detect most issues before they were detected by a developer or reported by a
                    client. One time, a site was linked as xxx.htm however the correct spelling was xxx.html,
                    the bot was able to immediately detect around 200 404 responses and the issue was fixed promptly.
                    Without the bot, the issue would have persisted much longer and would have affected many more users.
                    Overall, the bot is very effective at quickly reporting problems and minimizing the time to the find
                    the source of the problem.

                Developed a web scraper that scrapes Tripadvisor and Booking.com for the hotel name, price and rating of
                hotels in a given area. The project runs on a Flask Framework, the screenshots below demonstrate the
                frontend.
                The backend uses Selenium to scrape the data and Pandas to generate the graphs. The software was used by
                Fuengirola Beach Hotel to asses their market position. Apart from being useful to hotel managers it is
                also very useful as a tool to find hotels at a good price range with a good rating. At one point I gave
                the software a list of cities and scraped data for days straight until I had millions of entries and was
                able to analyze that data using Pandas, there were lots of interesting observations to be made like what
                the average rating per city was, the average price per city, the cheapest hotel in any given city etc.

                Additionally, in order to highlight a specific hotel in the graphs that are generated, the user should
                pass the name of the hotel as it appears in Booking.com and as it appears in Tripadvisor.

        <div class="textentry">Programmed an implementation of Linux malloc, realloc and free in C. Used mmap to give
            the user requested memory. The purpose of this memory allocator was to primarily allocate smaller slots of
            memory, in order to optimize this I used bucket sorting and memory allocations that increase in powers of 2.
            So if the user initially requests 10 bytes, the malloc function will return a 16 byte slot to the user.
            Whenever a bucket is filled for a given power of 2, a new bucket is created of size 4096 bytes or a page
            table, this reduces the number of system calls and in turn optimized the memory allocation process. For
            bigger memory allocations the program was not very optimized. The program was also thread safe and compared
            to a more naive malloc implementation it performed very well. The image below shows the benchmark test
            performed for two programs ivec and list, hwx is a naive implementation of malloc and opt is the optimized
            version of malloc. The optimized malloc was considerably faster for both programs.
